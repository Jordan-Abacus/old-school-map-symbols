# Old-School Map Symbols Foundry VTT Module

## How to install

Install manually the latest build by pasting this manifest url: https://github.com/JordanRR/old-school-map-symbols/releases/latest/download/module.json

This module includes old-school map symbols meant to be used as tiles. They are organized and tagged using the Baileywiki Mass Edit module, but are usable without it as regular tiles. All images are webp files sized 100 px per square.

Thank you!
