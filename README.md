This module includes old-school map symbols meant to be used as tiles. They are organized and tagged using the Baileywiki Mass Edit module, but are usable without it as regular tiles. 

Manually install using this manifest url: https://github.com/JordanRR/old-school-map-symbols/releases/download/2025-03-22/module.json
