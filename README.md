# Old-school map symbols Foundry VTT module
 
This module includes old-school map symbols meant to be used as tiles. They are organized and tagged using the Baileywiki Mass Edit module, but are usable without it as regular tiles. 

All images are webp files sized 100 px per square.

The tiles are from Mark Gosbell under CC0. https://markgosbell.itch.io/ I modified and adpated some of them, released under CC0. https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
